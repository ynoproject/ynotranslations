# ynotranslations
Repository to host translations for the games present on [YNOproject](https://ynoproject.net).

## Installation Instructions
These instructions will allow you to use these translations offline.

### Requirements
* Download and install the [EasyRPG Player](https://easyrpg.org/player/downloads/) (make sure to use the version 0.8.0 or more recent, this info should be displayed on startup)
* Download the content of the repository (on the main page of the repository, `Code` -> `Download ZIP`)
* Download one of the games compatible with the translations available (Yume Nikki requires the [English Steam version](https://store.steampowered.com/app/650700/Yume_Nikki/), Amillusion requires the [latest English version](https://ynfg.yume.wiki/Amillusion#Download) and Dream Genie requires the [latest English version](https://ynfg.yume.wiki/Dream_Genie_(梦鬼)#Original), all the other games require to use the latest version released by their author(s) in their original language)

### Process
1. Unzip the content of the ynotranslations zip
2. Put the folder containing the translations of the game (named after the name of the game) in the folder of said game (the folder with the MapXXX.lmu files - make sure to put the folder in it, not just its content)
3. Rename said folder to `Language`
4. Put the executable of the EasyRPG Player in the folder of the game or one of its root directories and start it (in the latter case, after launching the Player, select the folders leading to the game to start it)
5. Once on the title screen, you should have an option to change the language of the game

If you want to use a translation for the game Braingirl, you will need to pass the argument `--language {LANGUAGE}` to the executable (where `{LANGUAGE}` is the name of the folder of the translation wanted), which will launch the game directly in the selected language without having to use the language menu. Note that using this argument to start a game without a `Language` folder will force the Player to close, so make sure to not use it in said case.
