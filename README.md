# ynotranslations
Repository to host translations for the games present on [YNOproject](https://ynoproject.net). User-submitted translations are welcomed on this repository.

## Installation Instructions
These instructions will allow you to use these translations offline.

### Requirements
* Download the [EasyRPG Player](https://easyrpg.org/player/downloads/) (make sure to use the version 0.8.0 or more recent, this info should be displayed on startup).
* Download the content of this repository (on the main page of the repository, `Code` -> `Download ZIP`).
* Download one of the games compatible with the translations available. Yume Nikki requires the [English Steam version](https://store.steampowered.com/app/650700/Yume_Nikki/), [Amillusion](https://ynfg.yume.wiki/Amillusion#Download), [Dream Genie](https://ynfg.yume.wiki/Dream_Genie_(梦鬼)#Original), and [FOG](https://rosegorm.itch.io/fog) require their latest English version, and [OneShot requires the EasyRPG adaptation made for YNOproject](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KQFx1mACXlGNamy1dM2tIZqx2JZNVLDk/view?usp=drive_link). All the other games require to use the latest version released by their author(s) in their original language (Yume 2kki can be found [here](https://wikiwiki.jp/yumenikki-g3/), [while the other fangames can be searched here](https://ynfg.yume.wiki/Yume_Nikki_Fangames_Wiki). Make sure to download a complete version, or a complete version and a patch if you want to play Yume 2kki).
* Download the [RTP of RPG Maker 2000 and/or 2003](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/run-time-package), if the game requires it. Yume 2kki and Ultra Violet require the RPG Maker 2000 RTP ([preferably in Japanese](https://tkool.jp/products/rtp/2000rtp.zip), otherwise [Yume 2kki will display a warning when saving](https://github.com/EasyRPG/Player/issues/3172), though this doesn't affect the gameplay), while Collective Unconscious and Uneven Dream require the RPG Maker 2003 RTP.

### Process
1. Unzip the content of the ynotranslations zip file.
2. Put the folder containing the translations of the game (named after the name of the game) in the folder of said game (the folder with the MapXXXX.lmu files - make sure to put the folder in it, not just its content).
3. Rename said folder to `Language`.
4. Put the executable of the EasyRPG Player in the folder of the game or one of its root directories and start it (in the latter case, after launching the Player, select the folder(s) leading to the game to start it). Some platforms such as homebrews or Android may require to put your games in specific locations rather than where you want, so make sure to follow that too.
5. Once on the title screen, you should have an option to change the language of the game. Alternatively, in the latest version of the Player, opening the settings menu (accessible by pressing F1 or the Start button of a controller) should display a Language option if the translations are properly installed.

If you want to use a translation for the game Braingirl or OneShot, change the language through the settings menu if you are using an up to date version of the Player, or alternatively, you will need to pass the argument `--language {LANGUAGE}` to the executable (where `{LANGUAGE}` is the name of the folder of the translation wanted), which will launch the game directly in the selected language without having to use the language menu (using this argument to start a game without a `Language` folder will force older versions of the Player to close, so make sure to not use it in said case).

### Installing the RTP
This part assumes you are installing the RTP on Windows. If you are not, please refer to the [RTP page of the EasyRPG Wiki](https://wiki.easyrpg.org/user/player/rtp) for more specific details for your platform. If you want to install a Japanese RTP, you will need to use a locale application emulator such as [Locale Emulator](https://xupefei.github.io/Locale-Emulator/), or change the locale of your OS when launching the installer, otherwise the installation will fail at 44%.
1. Use the wizard installer given with the RTP download.
2. Process through the installation.
After this, the RTP should be installed, and EasyRPG Player should be able to detect it on the next launch.

## Producing a Translation
These instructions will allow you to create a translation for a game. These instructions can also be used for translating other RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 games, though some points may differ if you want to do that.

### Requirements
* A po file editor, such as [Poedit](https://poedit.net/). Alternatively, a text editor can be used, but it is NOT recommended as the syntax can vary for `\` characters, and that it is way easier to break the intended syntax, making the file unusable, which should not happen while using a proper tool.
* A text editor to edit the meta.ini file.
* A picture file editor, such as [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/), [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)... Any can be used as long as it doesn't butcher the index, colours used and format.
* The EasyRPG tool [lcftrans](https://easyrpg.org/tools/) to generate the po files of the game needed for the translation, and to easily update them to the latest version of the game. Alternatively, if you do not understand or cannot make it work, you can either use the po files of another translation as the basis of yours (though it may not be up to date or not contain all the lines depending on what you pick), or ask for help in the [YNOproject Discord server](https://ynoproject.net/discord) or in one of the [EasyRPG platforms](https://easyrpg.org/contact/).
* [EasyRPG Player](https://easyrpg.org/player/downloads/) (make sure to use the version 0.8.0 or more recent, this info should be displayed on startup), to be able to test your translation.

#### Optional/Per Game/Language
* An audio file editor if there are vocals to translate, such as [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/), though no audio files are translated in those games at the moment.
* If the game uses xyz files to store its pictures to translate (done for some files in Yume 2kki, done for all files in Yume Nikki, Mikan Muzou and OneShot), use the EasyRPG tools [xyz2png and png2xyz](https://easyrpg.org/tools/) to convert those files between the png (for edition) and xyz (for release) formats. Alternatively, you can use RPG Maker 2000 or 2003 to convert those files, by opening a project, going in the Resource Manager, and select Import file to the XYZ format, or Export file to the PNG format, both by selecting the file wanted. To more easily view the xyz files while searching in the various folders, you can use the EasyRPG tool [XYZ Thumbnailer](https://easyrpg.org/tools/) to be able to preview them in your file explorer.
* If you need to use a custom font due to EasyRPG not supporting your set of characters out of the box, you can download and install a custom font. It will need to be added in the folder of your language folder, in a folder named `Font`, and have one be named Font, and another named Font2 (the game can use either one or the other at any time depending on which settings are used, so it may be better to set the two rather than just the one currently in use by the game). Extensions supported are .fon, .fnt, .bdf, .ttf, .ttc, .otf, .woff2, and .woff.

### Before Starting
- [Yume 2kki has rules tied to translations that must be respected](https://wikiwiki.jp/yumenikki-g3/%E6%B1%BA%E5%AE%9A%E4%BA%8B%E9%A0%85#TranslationGuidelines): please consult them before working on any translation work for Yume 2kki.
- If you want to work on a translation for Collective Unconscious, please enter in contact with the Collective Unconscious Team to do so (the Collective Unconscious Development Discord server is linked in the YNOproject Discord server).
- If you are submitting a translation for OneShot, do not base your work/do not reuse the commercial translations of OneShot.
- Do not upload translations, assets from translations or assets you do not have the right for.

### Process
1. In the folder of your game, create a folder named `Language` next to the other game folders (Battle, CharSet, Picture...), if one doesn't exist yet.
2. In the Language folder, create a `{LANGUAGE}` folder (where `{LANGUAGE}` is the [Set 1 ISO Language Name of your language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes), e.g. `de` for German, `fr` for French, `ja` for Japanese, `zh` for Chinese...). This will be your language folder to work with.
3. Create a Meta.ini in the folder of your language.
4. Write the Meta.ini file based on the syntax present on the [EasyRPG Translation Guide](https://easyrpg.org/player/guide/game_translation/). Write the name of your language in your own language for the `Name` field, and write a short description including contributors for the `Description` field, unless the character set of your own language is not supported without defining font which is not done before the language is selected: in that case, please write them in English. The Language word used for the `Term` field must match with how the game writes entries on the title screen (e.g. Yume 2kki centers the text, Dream Genie only uses the first letter, FOG writes in all capital letters...). Only include the `GameTitle` field if it is translated in your language.
5. Generate the po files needed for your translation by using lcftrans, by using the create or update command and pointing at the path of the game, following the syntax of the command present on the [EasyRPG Translation Guide](https://easyrpg.org/player/guide/game_translation/), or use a set of po files from an existing translation of the wanted game.
6. Copy the po files in the folder of your language.
7. Delete the po files that are empty (can be the case with RPG_RT.ldb.battle.po), contain no text to translate (e.g. only lines there to display money or variable with no text to translate), and delete the RPG_RT.lmt.po file as well (contains the names of all maps, which are only used in 1) the debug menu to teleport to another map 2) the teleport skill menu to teleport to another map 3) if a Maniac patch game requests the map name using the command Control String Variables, none of them tied to the games translated here).
8. Translate the po files that contain lines you will translate using your po file editor (select a line, and write its translation, do not overwrite the lines in their original language). If a line is the same between the original language and your language, no need to translate it as the line in the original language will be used. If a message contains `\` characters, make sure to follow the syntax used in the original message. If a message box made out of several lines must take more than the four lines allowed by the game, you can write `<easyrpg:new_page>` after your fourth line, then format it as if it was a new message box. Lastly, `\_` corresponds to an half space in RPG Maker, which can be useful in some cases to center text or to fit more text in a place where no alternative is possible.
9. Delete the mo files generated by the po tool used, as those files aren't used for the translations.
10. Check the various folders of the game you want to translate, and locate files containing text you want to translate (for example, pictures in the Picture folder containing instructions).
11. Add the files you want to translate to the folder of your language, by replicating the file structure (e.g. if you were interested in the file `instructions` in the `Picture` folder, add a `Picture` folder in the folder of your translation, and place your `instructions` file there, while keeping the same filename).
12. Translate the files you need to translate using the appropriate tools (e.g. picture file editor to edit pictures). Make sure to not alter the colours used while editing your picture, to not change the colour used as the first placement in the index (this colour is used for transparency if the command calling it in-game is set to use transparency, so altering it would lead to display issues), and to respect how the original picture looks and how it should look whenever possible (graphy, colours used...).
13. Test your translation (see the next section), by placing the EasyRPG Player in the folder of the game (or below it), and launching it.
14. If everything is translated and works correctly, you can create a pull request to include your content in this repository.

### Testing Process
- Test each place where text is displayed and where translated assets are used. This includes the menu, save menu, load menu, all characters/items/skills used in the game, and more globally every place where the game uses text.
- Make sure each line is translated.
- Make sure each line is displayed entirely and is not cut, unless intended.
- Make sure no text markers were forgotten.
- Make sure every asset is properly displayed.
- Make sure every asset is properly set to be transparent when it should, and set to not be transparent when it should not.
- Make sure no unneeded/useless file is present (no content, no content to translate, mo file...).

### Testing Tips
- You can use the Fast Forward function in EasyRPG (hold F for x3 speed, G for x10) to go faster to places containing text to translate. You can also open the settings (by pressing F1 or the Start button of a controller) and change the speed set for those keys to go up to x100.
- You can use the TestPlay mode of EasyRPG to make things easier. To enable it, either pass the argument `--test-play` to the executable, replace the executable of the game (RPG_RT.exe) by the EasyRPG Player one and start the game through RPG Maker, or put the Player in a folder below the one of your game, and press Shift in the game browser while selecting your game to start it in TestPlay mode. While in TestPlay mode, you can press F9 to open the Debug Menu, which allows you to open the menu, save menu and load menu, useful to test their lines and save anywhere, allow you to give yourself all the items of the game, making it easier to test them, and allowing you to teleport directly to the maps containing text by selecting their ID. Holding CTRL will allow you to walk through walls, F10 interrupt the current running event, F11 save where you want, and Shift display test instantaneously.
- When generating a Map po file, each line will have a comment containing `ID X, Page Y, Line Z, Pos (A,B)`. The Pos corresponds to the coordinates where the event is on the map, so you can directly teleport yourself to the event using the teleport action in the Debug Menu. Alternatively, ID corresponds to the ID of the event containing the line, and Page in which page of the event it is, so you can use the function Call Event in the Debug Menu by specifying the ID and Page to more quickly display the line.
- You can use RPG Maker to slightly edit the games to give yourself what you want, such as skills, allow you to access specific menus to more quickly see things, or again directly display the assets needed. If you do that, make sure it doesn't affect the assets in use, such as the generated po files.

### Updating a Translation when a Game is Updated
1. Check the various folders of the game in search of assets to translate, and compare them with the ones you have in your translation: if one doesn't match with the latest version (no longer present, renamed, updated), make sure it matches with the latest version (delete, rename, update).
2. Use lcftrans' update command on your po files (see the [EasyRPG Translation Guide](https://easyrpg.org/player/guide/game_translation/)), by comparing the lines with the one of the latest version of the game, and use the updated po files made from this command in your translation. When updating po files, stale po files may be generated: those include lines that were translated in your translation, but are no longer present in the latest version, either due to the text getting modified (typo correction/change of formulation), or simply due to the lines getting removed. You can use those stale files as a basis if the lines they contain are still used some way or another in the latest version, but do not include those files in your translation as they do not do anything.
3. Update the content of those po files by translating the needed lines.
4. Test your translation (see the previous section).
5. If everything is translated and works correctly, you can create a pull request to include your content in this repository.

### QA
Q: The game crashes with an error "Language/{LANGUAGE}/{FILE}.po Parse error (Line)" when I try to use my translation!

A: This happens if the po file was edited without respecting the syntax. Edit the line mentioned in the error to make it respect the syntax of the file, then try to open your translation, it should now work without issues.

Q: I wrote the content of the Meta.ini file properly, but it is not used in-game!

A: Make sure your Meta.ini file is not saved as UTF-16: you can use UTF-8 to save it.

Q: One of the translated pictures I use lacks transparency when it should be transparent on specific parts, or is transparent while it should not!

A: The colour used as the transparent colour is determined depending on the order of colours in the index: the first one in the list is the one that is used for the transparency. Move the colour intended to be transparent in the original file at the same location in your translated file to solve the issue.

Q: Is there any efficient way to center a text?

A: A line of text in RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 can be at most 50 characters in length. You can use half spaces instead of full spaces by typing `\_`. Using both, if you want to center a line of text, you can do: (50-{NUMBER_OF_CHARACTERS_IN_TEXT_TO_CENTER})/2 = Number of characters to put before your text to center it (and if the result ends up by .5, this is where the half space comes into play).

Q: The game in its original language uses a specific font, but I would like to use the default font for my translation, is that possible?

A: You can add `Font=Builtin` in the Meta.ini of your translation to make it use the default font of the engine. Alternatively, you can place a font file named `Font` or `Font2` in the `Font` folder of your translation to use a specific font.

Q: Is it possible to translate the lines used for the settings menu, the warnings, the message when closing the game...?

A: No. Those lines are taken directly from the EasyRPG Player and are not part of the game, [and no translation as part of the Player is provided at the moment](https://github.com/EasyRPG/Player/issues/3100).

Q: Is it possible to make the game automatically start in the last used language without needing any command?

A: Not at the moment, [though it may (or may not) happen in the future](https://github.com/EasyRPG/Player/pull/3348).

### Font Resources for Pictures
MS Mincho and MS Gothic are fonts used in RPG Maker 2000 and 2003, so you may expect them to appear in some pictures (used for the intro text in Yume 2kki, the menu in the Platformer World, the text at the bottom of the title screen, for instance). Other fonts may have been hand-drawn for the game and/or translation, or use a font which is not known.

- Yume 2kki: the font [k8x12s by Num Kadoma](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/k8x12-font/#previewtool) is used for the press any key text during the intro.
- Uneven Dream: the font for the loading screen is [URW Antiqua](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/urw/antiqua?lang=en).
- She Awaits: the font [Rainy Hearts by Camellina](https://www.dafont.com/rainyhearts.font) is used for the instructions.
- FOG: the font [Chango by Fontstage](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Chango) is used for the line "a dreamFOG game" in the credits; [Press Start 2P by CodeMan38](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P) for the rest of the credits; [TeX Gyre Adventor by Herb Lubalin and Tom Carnase](https://www.1001fonts.com/tex-gyre-adventor-font.html) for the "The Seven Dreamers will return." line. The small type lettering uses its own separate font.
